#   slash_detect_pkg_type          # sets SLASH_PKG_TYPE and SLASH_PKG_DISTRO
#   slash_installed_packages       # prints the installed subset, one per line

# The package names must match packaging/debian/control and packaging/rpm/slash.spec.
# "ami" comes from submodules/AVED and is built by scripts/package-ami.sh, but it is
# installed and removed alongside the rest, so it belongs in these lists.
